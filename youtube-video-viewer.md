You can also download the file to run the program yourself.



To run the program, you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} installed.

Then, you can start with this command and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in your browser.
```
npx next start
```

You can also specify the port with the `-p` argument.
```
npx next start -p 8080
```

Instead, you can run the script in the folder (`run.bat` for Windows or `run.sh` for Linux).
