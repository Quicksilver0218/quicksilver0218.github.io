# AlphaZero
A simplified AlphaZero implementation written in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.

The implementation is based on the [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
published to Nature by David Silver, Julian Schrittwieser, Karen Simonyan et al.

Here is a demonstration with Tic-Tac-Toe.
